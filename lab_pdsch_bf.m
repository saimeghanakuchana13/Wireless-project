%% Lab:  5G NR Downlink Simulation with Beamforming 
% Beamforming is an essential component of the millimeter wave (mmWave)
% communication systems.  This lab will demonstrate simple beamforming
% and channel modeling for a downlink transmissions in the 5G New Radio
% standard. In performing this lab, you will learn to:
% 
% * Model realistic antenna arrays and elements
% * Compute beamforming vectors and the associated antenna factors
% * Model multi-path fading channels in time-domain
% * Modulate and demodulate symbols on the 5G NR downlink data channel 
%   using the  
%   <https://www.mathworks.com/help/5g/index.html MATLAB 5G Toolbox>.
% * Measure the quality of the demodulated symbols
% * Organize complex projects into packages
%
% % *Submission*:  Complete all the sections marked |TODO|, and run the cells 
% to make sure your scipt is working.  When you are satisfied with the 
% results,  <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/publishing-matlab-code.html
% publish your code> to generate an html file.  Print the html file to
% PDF and submit the PDF.

%% Packages
% Similar to python, you can group code with a common functionality 
% into a
% <https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_oop/scoping-classes-with-packages.html
% MATLAB package>.  Using packages enables better organized, more modular
% code.  For several of the remaining labs, the repository contains
% a folder |+nr| containing some routines for simulating 5G NR systems.
% These functions were mostly helper functions taken from 
% <https://www.mathworks.com/help/5g/examples/nr-pdsch-throughput.html
% MATLAB's excellent demo> on 5G throughput.  In this lab, we will use
% just a small portion of the code.
% 
% To use the package, you must first add the folder containing this +nr
% to your MATLAB path. 

% TODO:  Use the MATLAB addpath() command to add the folder with the nr
% package.  You can use indirect referencing like '..'.


%% Parameters
% We will use the following parameters
fc = 28e9;          % carrier frequency in Hz
nantUE = [4,4];     % array size at the UE (mobile device)
nantgNB = [8,8];    % array size at the gNB (base station)
snrPerAntenna = -5; % target SNR per sample per antenna  
ueVel = [5 0 0];    % UE velocity vector in m/s
subcarrierSpacing = 120;  % sub-carrier spacing in kHz

% Creates simulation parameters for this lab
simParam = PDSCHSimParam('fc', fc);
 NLayers = 1;    % number of layers
 Modulation = 'QPSK';  
NRB = 51;  % number of resource blocks
SubcarrierSpacing = 120;  % SCS in kHZ
        
%carrierConfig = nrCarrierConfig(...
%    'NSizeGrid', NRB, 'SubcarrierSpacing', SubcarrierSpacing);
%waveformConfig = nrOFDMInfo(carrierConfig);
%% Loading the 3GPP NR channel model
% We will load the same channel as in the previous lab.  
dlySpread = 50e-9;  % delay spread in seconds
chan = nrCDLChannel('DelayProfile','CDL-A',...
    'DelaySpread',dlySpread, 'CarrierFrequency', fc, ...
    'NormalizePathGains', true);
chaninfo = info(chan);

% Get the gains and other path parameters
gain = chaninfo.AveragePathGains;
aoaAz  = chaninfo.AnglesAoA;
aoaEl = 90-chaninfo.AnglesZoA;
aodAz  = chaninfo.AnglesAoD;
aodEl = 90-chaninfo.AnglesZoD;
dly = chaninfo.PathDelays;

%% Create the element
% We will use the same patch element on the UE and gNB as before.

% Constants
vp = physconst('lightspeed');  % speed of light
lambda = vp/fc;   % wavelength

% Create a patch element
len = 0.49*lambda;
groundPlaneLen = lambda;
elem = patchMicrostrip(...
    'Length', len, 'Width', 1.5*len, ...
    'GroundPlaneLength', groundPlaneLen, ...
    'GroundPlaneWidth', groundPlaneLen, ...
    'Height', 0.01*lambda, ...
    'FeedOffset', [0.25*len 0]);

% Tilt the element so that the maximum energy is in the x-axis
elem.Tilt = 90;
elem.TiltAxis = [0 1 0];

%% Creating an element wrapper class
% A problem with the Phased Array Toolbox is that the element patterns
% are not smoothly interpolated.  Also, we want to support antennas
% that have analytic functions for their pattern.  To support this, 
% we will use a wrapper class, InterpPatternAntenna.  This class
% derives from the system.Matlab super-class.  Its step method provides
% the directivity as a function of the angles.  We can then replace
% this class with any other class that provides a formula for the
% directivity.

% TODO:  Complete the setupImpl and stepImpl() methods in 
% the InterPatternAntenna class.  This mostly follows the same syntax
% as the previous lab.

% TODO:  Create a wrapper object for the elem
%     elemInterp = InterpPatternAntenna(...);
elemInterp = InterpPatternAntenna(elem,fc);

%% Create the arrays
% We next create arrays at the UE and gNB

% TODO:  Create two URAs with the sizes nantUE and nantgNB.
% Both arrays should be separated at 0.5 lambda.
%    arrUE0 = URA for the UE
%    arrgNB0 = URA for the gNB
dsep = 0.5*lambda;
arrgNB0 = phased.URA(nantgNB,dsep);
arrUE0 = phased.URA(nantUE,dsep);
%% Create the array with axes
% Similar to the previous lab, we will create a wrapper class around
% the arrays to handle orientation modeling.  The ArrayWithAxes
% class includes an array along with axes to store the orientation of the
% array relative to some global coordinate system.

% TODO:  Complete the setupImpl() and stepImpl() methods in the
% ArrayWithAxes class.

% TODO:  Create ArrayWithAxes objects for the gNB and UE with the 
% arrays, arrUE0 and arrgNB0, and elements, elemInterp.  Also
% set the frequency and velocity.
%    arrgNB = ArrayWithAxes(...);
%    arrUE  = ArrayWithAxes(...);
velgNB = [30,0,0];
velUE = [30,0,0];
arrgNB = ArrayWithAxes('elem', elemInterp, 'arr', arrgNB0, 'vel', velgNB, 'fc', fc);
arrUE  = ArrayWithAxes('elem', elemInterp, 'arr', arrUE0, 'vel', velUE, 'fc', fc);


%% Rotate the UE and gNB antennas
% Similar to the previous lab, we will rotate the arrays to the path
% with the maximum gain.

% TODO:  Find the index of the path with the maximum gain
[~,im] = max(gain);

% TODO:  Call the arrUE.alignAxes() and arrgNB.alignAxes() to 
% align to the corresponding angles of arrival and departure.
arrUE.alignAxes(aoaAz(im),aoaEl(im));
arrgNB.alignAxes(aodAz(im),aodEl(im));
%% Compute the gains along the paths
% To see the potential gain from beamforming, we will compute the 
% array factor and element gain along each path

% TODO:  Find the spatial signatures and element gains of each path
% based on their angles of arrival and departure.
%   [utx, elemGainTx] = arrgNB.step(...);
%   [urx, elemGainRx] = arrUE.step(...);

[utx, elemGainTx] = arrgNB.step(aoaAz, aoaEl);
[urx, elemGainRx] = arrUE.step(aodAz, aodEl);

% TODO:  Compute the TX beamforming direction at the gNB and RX BF 
% direction at the UE.  To keep the beamforming simple, we will align
% the directions to the strongest path.  Thus, the BF directions should
% be complex conjugate of the steering vectors.  They should also be
% normalized.
%     wtx = TX direction at the gNB
%     wrx = RX direction at the UE

wtx = conj(utx(:,im));
wtx = wtx / norm(wtx);


wrx = conj(urx(:,im));
wrx = wrx / norm(wrx);

% TODO:  Compute the array factors at the gNB and UE
% from the BF vectors and spatial signatures, utx and urx.
%    AFgNB(i) = array factor gain on path i in dBi at the gNB
%    AFUE(i) = array factor gain in path i dBi at the UE
AFgNB = 10*log10( abs(sum(wtx.*utx, 1)).^2 );
AFUE = 10*log10( abs(sum(wrx.*urx, 1)).^2 );

% TODO:  Compute the gain on each path adding the array factors
% and elemement gains.
%    gainDir = gain + ...

gainDir = gain + AFgNB + AFUE;
% TODO:  Use the stem plot to plot both the original gain and 
% gainDir, the gain with directivity.  Add a legend and label the axes.
% You will see that, with directivity, many of the paths are highly 
% attenuated and a few are very significantly amplified.
stem(dly/1e-9,[gain;gainDir]','BaseValue', -40);
grid on;

ylabel('Gain(dB)')
legend('Omni', 'with directivity')

%% Generate a 5G TX signal 
% We will now test the array processing by transmitting a 5G downlink
% signal.  Specifically, we will transmit random QPSK symbols on the
% locations of the PDSCH channel, the channel in the 5G NR standard
% for data.  The lab supplies a simple class, NRgNBTx, to perform this
% function.  Most of the class is implemented and extensively uses
% commands from the 5G Toolbox.

% TODO:  Complete the code in the NRgNBTx.stepImpl() method to
% perform the TX beamforming.  


% TODO:  Create a TX object using the NRgNBTx object.  Pass the simParam
% object.
%    tx = NRgNBTx(...);
tx = NRgNBTx(simParam);
% TODO:  Set the BF vector of the TX
tx.txBF = wtx;
% TODO:  Generate one slot of symbols using the step() method
%    x = ...
%size(wtx)
x = tx.step();
imagesc(abs(x));
colorbar()
%%
% The slot of data produced by this data contains two channels:
% * PDSCH:  The downlink data channel 
% * DM-RS:  Demodulation reference signals for channel estimation at the 
%   RX.  We will discuss this later.

% TODO:  Print the sampling rate in MHz and total time (in us) of the data.  
% You can use the info in tx.waveformConfig.
fprintf(1, 'Sampling rate = %7.2f MHz\n', tx.waveformConfig.SampleRate/1e6);
fprintf(1,'Slot duration = %7.2f us\n', size(x,1)*1e6/tx.waveformConfig.SampleRate);


% TODO:  Print the following:
% * Total number of REs (this can be found from the number of el    ements in 
%   tx.ofdmGridLayer), the time-freq grid for the symbols in the slot
% * Number of REs for the DM-RS:  From tx.dmrsSym
% * Number of REs for the PDSCH:  From tx.pdschSym
nchan = 2;
fprintf(1,'Total REs: %d \n', numel(tx.ofdmGridLayer));
fprintf(1,'REs for DMRS: %d \n', length(tx.dmrsSym));
fprintf(1,'REs for PDSCH: %d \n', length(tx.pdschSym));

%for i = 1:nchan
%    p = mean(tx.ofdmGridChan == i,2);
%    fprintf('Channel :  %7.3f\n', p);
%end

%% Create the MIMO multi-path channel
% We will now simulate the channel in time-domain.  The lab supplies
% code, MIMOMPChan, which is a MIMO version of the SISOMPChan
% you created in the previous lab.

% TODO:  Complete the code in the stepImpl() method of the code.

% TODO:  Create the MIMOMPChan object with all the AoAs, AoDs, gains
% arrays, delays and sampling rate.  
%    chan = ...

chan = MIMOMPChan('fsamp', tx.waveformConfig.SampleRate, 'dly', dly, 'gain', gainDir, ...
                 'txArr', arrgNB, 'rxArr', arrUE, 'aoaAz', aoaAz, 'aoaEl', aoaEl, ...
                  'aodAz', aodAz, 'aodEl', aodEl);
% TODO:  Create the output
%   y = chan.step(...)
y = chan.step(x);

%% Add noise
% In multi-antenna receivers, the SNR is typically quoted as the SNR per
% antenna.  Specifically, suppose that
%    ynoisy = y + w.
% The SNR per antenna is E|y(t,j)|^2/E|w(t,j)|^2.  Create a
% matrix ynoisy using the snrPerAntenna.
snr = 20;
[n,m] = size(y);
wvar = mean(abs(y(:)).^2)*10^(-0.1*snr);
ynoisy = y + sqrt(wvar/2)*(randn(n,m) + 1i*randn(n,m));

%% Create a UE receiver
% We will now demodulate the noisy symbols.   The lab supplies a simple 
% class, NRUErx, to perform this function.  Most of the class is 
% implemented and extensively uses commands from the 5G Toolbox.  You just 
% have to do a small modification to support BF.  

% TODO:  Modify the stepImpl() method of NRUERx to implement RX
% beamforming.

% TODO:  Create a RX object with the correct rxBF vector
%   rx = NRUERx(...)
 rx = NRUERx(simParam, 'rxBF', wrx);
% TODO:  Run the rx.step() method with ynoisy to receive the signals
rx.step(ynoisy);
% TODO:  The equalized symbols are now stored in rx.pdschSym. 
plot(real(rx.pdschSymEq),imag(rx.pdschSymEq),'o')
%% Measure the SNR
% When you plot the final equalized symbols you will see that there
% is a lot of noise.  Also there is a phase rotation which comes
% from the Doppler shift that was not corrected.  In reality, you would
% have some carrier frequency offset to remove this.  We will also discuss
% this later.  For now, we measure the post-equalized SNR.
%
% One way to measure the post-equalized SNR is:
%    snrEq = 10*log10( E|r|^2 / E| r - h*x |^2 )
% where r is the recived raw symbols (in this case rx.pdschSymRaw)
% h is the channel estimate (rx.pdschChanEst) and 
% x is the transmitted symbols (tx.pdschSym).

% TODO:  Compute and print the post-equalized SNR in dB
Eerr = mean(abs(rx.pdschSymRaw - rx.pdschChanEst.*tx.pdschSym).^2);
Erx = mean(abs(rx.pdschSymRaw).^2);
snrEq = 10*log10(Erx/Eerr);
fprintf(1,'SNR post equalization = %7.2f\n',snrEq);




%%
% Since the RX signal ynoisy already includes the antenna element gain,
% The post-equalized SNR should be:
%     snrTheory = snrPerAntenna + bwGain + BFGain
% where BFGain is the BF gain and bwGain is the gain since we are
% transmitting on tx.waveformConfig.NSubcarriers out of
% tx.waveformConfig.Nfft FFT frequency bins.  Ideally the BF gain
% is the number of UE antennas.  You will notice that snrTheory 
% is a little higher than what we received.  This is mostly since the 
% receiver we built here does not compensate for frequency offset.

% TODO:  Compute and print snrTheory.
nantrx = prod(nantUE);
bwGain = 10*log10(tx.waveformConfig.Nfft/tx.waveformConfig.NSubcarriers);
snrTheory = snrPerAntenna + bwGain + 10*log10(nantrx);
fprintf(1,'SNR theoretical = %7.2f\n',snrTheory)
